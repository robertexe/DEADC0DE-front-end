# DEADC0DE (frontend)

A platform where junior developers can find `beginner-friendly` open source projects. Users may save projects on to a queue and remove them as they go. Users can also ask for help by posting their own projects on to the forum section similar to Stackoverflow.

## Objective

Working on open source projects may be a little daunting for developers just starting off. One of the many obstacles for junior developers is finding something easy and related to the technology they've just learned. DEADC0DE pulls up a list of `beginner-friendly` open source projects after you've chosen which language you'd like help out in.

## Getting Started
